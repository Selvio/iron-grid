/**
 * Match-membership authorization guard (M5-T4).
 *
 * The reusable primitive that enforces `validate_membership_on_every_read` /
 * `_on_every_write` (`backend.md` §7, §12): a session may touch a match only when
 * it owns an **accepted** `match_players` row for it — the host, or a guest whose
 * invitation has been accepted (`user_id` set, M4-T4 / spec §3.3). It is a
 * standalone function; M6/M7 place it at the head of their lifecycle and action
 * flows (`action_processing.ordered_steps`) — nothing wires it into an endpoint
 * here.
 *
 * Like the M4 db primitives (`lockMatchForUpdate`), it threads the caller's db /
 * transaction handle so M7 can run it inside the same transaction as the mutation
 * it guards. It reads through the db layer and returns the membership so callers
 * need not re-query (`domain-model.md` §7).
 *
 * @see docs/03-architecture/backend.md §7, §12
 * @see docs/03-architecture/domain-model.md §7
 * @see docs/04-development/milestones/m5-auth.md (M5-T4)
